TODO list for the near future:
* Customization of CAN messages and signals - grab string from serial or web and convert to message ID, bits, scale, units, etc.
* Customization of each display - assingning signals, format, etc
* Saving these customizations to flash
* A simple web page served to enter these configurations - pull up 1.4 on your phone and fill in a few fields
* Logically standardize this to be handled by external phone or PC tools in the future over wifi

Other goodies on the soon list:
* Dump CAN logs to SD Card, if configured, triggered by pushbutton etc
* Reprogram over Wifi - Jake is on this already
* PC or phone tool to choose signals from a DBC file and send over their config
* Passing data over wifi to phone apps like TesLax and ScanMyTesla as a much higher bandwidth alternative to bluetooth OBD tools (on multiple busses from multiple canserves while I dream)

Whishlist for the further future:
* Long term time and signal filtered contiuous can logs...think Teslafi with thousands of signals
* Auto-connect to home wifi and server to dump logs etc
* Integration with something like Teslogger to cloud process that data
* Support for many more vehicles with CAN
