## CANserver Manual

CANserver is intended to connect to a CAN network and transmit live data to a microDisplay, but has many more potential uses! It has a powerful ESP32 board with WiFi and Bluetooth and is Arduino programmable.

### Installation

CANserver should be connected to your CAN network with a supplied cable harness.

**Tesla powertrain bus**

Use the OBD harness to connect to your car's built-in (2020+) OBD connector, or you will need to buy a 3rd party OBD harness that plugs behind the center console.

**Tesla chassis bus**

The CANserver is designed to plug and play easily under the passenger seat! Raise the seat to full height and look for a small box with a yellow connector. While the car is in Park, squeeze and pull to release the cable from the seat box. Plug it into the CANserver and plug the chassis pass-through cable into the seat box. Use the included double sized foam to mount the CANserver under the seat.
